I have experience in rigging and motion capture retargeting using 3rd party animation tools and plugins. I am trained in Maya and am experienced with Python. I focus on rapid and reusable solutions for rigging and animation tools. I've worked in both games and animation pipelines on everything from rigging to geometry caching. I really love what I do and I enjoy the challenges of the field.  
I am a married US citizen currently working in Paris, France.
