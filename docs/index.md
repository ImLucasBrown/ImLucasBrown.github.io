Hi there! Iâ€™m a 3D Technical Director with experience in full stack 
Python development, pipelines, automation, Shotgrid, rigging. I've been involved in everything from games to product design.   
I'm committed to easily extensible and rapidly deployable systems. I even write docstrings and unittests! 
I manage teams and projects with a focus on understanding the why and always thinking towards future expansion.
Highly motivated and excited to work with supervisors, artists, and programmers to
 create a well oiled, easy to use, CG pipeline.

### Open Source
I'm intricately involved in the [Node Execution Tree (NXT)](projects#nxt-node-execution-tree) project. NXT is an open source Python layering and execution tool for animation and VFX.  Since it first went public in late 2020, NXT has found it's way in to several large studios and projects.
