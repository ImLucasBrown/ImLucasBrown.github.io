# Lucas Brown - TD

Hi there! Iâ€™m a Pipeline TD/Technical artist with experience in full stack 
Python development, pipeline backend/tools, rigging, Pixar USD, and motion 
capture for animation and games.   
I'm committed to expandable and easily 
deployable systems. I even write docstrings and unittests! 
Highly motivated and excited to work with supervisors, artists, and programmers to
 create a well oiled, easy to use, CG pipeline.

Most recently I was intricately involved in the [Node Execution Tree (NXT)](projects#nxt-node-execution-tree) project. NXT is an open source Python layering and execution tool for animation and VFX.

Previously I worked as a rigger producing character and prop rigs for realtime environments. Below is my rigging reel.
