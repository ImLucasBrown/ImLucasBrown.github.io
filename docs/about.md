# Lucas Brown - TD

---

I have experience in rigging and motion capture retargeting using 3rd party animation tools and plugins.  
I am trained in Maya and am experienced with Python.  
I focus on rapid and reusable solutions for rigging and animation tools.  
I've worked in both games and animation pipelines on everything from rigging to geometry caching.  
I really love what I do, and I enjoy the challenges of the field.
