!!! note "What is NXT?"
    NXT is a Python layering and sequential execution tool for animation and VFX.


NXT visualizes complex scripts and empowers cross discipline collaboration. It bridges the gap
between one-off scripting and general purpose tools through the use of 
layering, inheritance, and string tokens.


In the simplest of terms nxt combines multiple layers of nodes into a single composite layer that is then executable. 
Something like Photoshop layers for your code, you're able to mute, solo, override, and extend layers of code. 
The resulting composite of the code clearly visualizes where attributes and their values came from. Colors, node paths, 
and conveniently placed buttons/links allow users to quickly jump to and correct erroneous values.
