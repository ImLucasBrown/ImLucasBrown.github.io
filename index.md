Hi there! I’m a Pipeline TD/Technical artist with experience in full stack 
Python development, pipeline backend/tools, rigging, Pixar USD, and motion 
capture for animation and games. I'm committed to expandable and easily 
deployable systems. I even write docstrings and unittests! 
Motivated and excited to work with supervisors, artists, and programmers to
 create a well oiled, easy to use, CG pipeline.
