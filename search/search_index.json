I\u2019m a Pipeline TD/Technical artist with experience in full stack Python development, pipeline backend/tools, rigging, Pixar USD, and motion capture for animation and games. I'm committed to expandable and easily deployable systems. I even write docstrings and unittests! Highly motivated and excited to work with supervisors, artists, and programmers to create a well oiled, easy to use, CG pipeline. Most recently I was intricately involved in the Node Execution Tree (NXT) project. NXT is an open source Python layering and execution tool for animation and VFX. Previously I worked as a rigger producing rigs for realtime environments. Below is my rigging reel. Resume Projects View or download a PDF of my resume. View Resume Check out some of my other work.

NXT is a Python layering and sequential execution tool for animation and VFX. NXT visualizes complex scripts and empowers cross discipline collaboration. It bridges the gap between one-off scripting and general purpose tools through the use of layering, inheritance, and string tokens. In the simplest of terms nxt combines multiple layers of nodes into a single composite layer that is then executable. Something like Photoshop layers for your code, you're able to mute, solo, override, and extend layers of code. The resulting composite of the code clearly visualizes where attributes and their values came from. Colors, node paths, and conveniently placed buttons/links allow users to quickly jump to and correct erroneous values. Learn more!
